# Database Deployment Status

## ✅ Current Status: READY FOR NEW SYSTEM DEPLOYMENT

All today's database changes will properly deploy on new systems.

## What's Included

### Schema Features
- ✅ **Hierarchical Variables**: Self-referential variable structure with parent/child relationships
- ✅ **Variable Hierarchy Fields**: `parentId`, `level`, `path`, `order`, `aggregationType`
- ✅ **ESG Framework**: Complete Pillar → Lever → Variable → VariableQuestion structure
- ✅ **User Management**: Role-based access with admin users
- ✅ **Survey System**: Full survey, question, response, and answer models

### Recent Fixes Applied
- ✅ **Hybrid Delete System**: Soft delete → preview → hard delete with impact analysis
- ✅ **Next.js 15 Compatibility**: Fixed async params issues
- ✅ **Hydration Errors**: Resolved HTML structure issues
- ✅ **Database Queries**: Fixed schema relationship issues in DELETE operations

## Migration Setup

### ✅ Migration Files Created
- **Location**: `prisma/migrations/0_init/migration.sql`
- **Status**: Applied and tracked in database
- **Contains**: Complete current schema with all hierarchical variable features

### ✅ Deployment Strategy
- **Docker**: Uses `prisma migrate deploy` for consistent deployments
- **Fallback**: Still includes `db push` for database readiness checks
- **Seeding**: Automatic population with admin user and sample data

## New System Deployment

When deploying to a new system:

1. **✅ Clone Repository**: All migration files are included
2. **✅ Run Docker Compose**: Will automatically:
   - Create database schema from migrations
   - Apply all indexes and relationships
   - Seed with initial data (admin user, pillars, levers, hierarchical variables)
3. **✅ Login Available**: admin@esg.com / admin123 (from seed data)

## What Will Work Immediately

### Core Features
- ✅ **Authentication**: User login/registration with roles
- ✅ **ESG Structure**: Pillars, levers, variables management
- ✅ **Hierarchical Variables**: Create root and child variables
- ✅ **Variable Operations**: Create, edit, activate/deactivate, hybrid delete
- ✅ **Parent Selection**: Choose between lever or variable as parent
- ✅ **Impact Preview**: Delete confirmation with dependency analysis

### User Interface
- ✅ **Variable Hierarchy Display**: Shows L0, L1, L2 levels with paths
- ✅ **Aggregation Types**: SUM, AVERAGE, WEIGHTED_AVERAGE, MAX, MIN
- ✅ **Status Management**: Active/inactive toggles with hierarchy validation
- ✅ **Safety Features**: Prevents activation of variables with inactive parents

## Database Schema Highlights

```sql
-- Key hierarchical variable features:
Variable {
  parentId       String?          -- Self-reference for hierarchy
  level          Int              -- Depth in hierarchy (0=root)
  path           String?          -- Full hierarchy path
  aggregationType String?         -- How to combine child scores
  leverId        String?          -- Root variables link to levers
}

-- Proper foreign key constraints ensure data integrity
-- Cascading deletes maintain referential integrity
-- Indexes optimize query performance for hierarchy operations
```

## Production Readiness

### ✅ Data Integrity
- Foreign key constraints prevent orphaned records
- Cascade deletes maintain consistency
- Unique constraints prevent duplicates
- Indexes optimize performance

### ✅ Operational Features
- Migration-based deployments
- Automated seeding for initial setup
- Role-based access control
- Comprehensive error handling

### ✅ Scalability Considerations
- Indexed hierarchy queries
- Efficient parent-child lookups
- Optimized aggregation paths
- Clean deletion strategies

**Summary**: The current codebase is fully prepared for deployment to new systems. All hierarchical variable functionality, recent fixes, and database schema changes are properly migrated and will deploy consistently across environments.
